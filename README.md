# AWS_IpInsights
An updated version of the aws ipinsights tutorial, with closer realistic problem challenges added. 

Here we used the AWS Ip insight model as an example to demonstrate how to bring a toy example to production level. I believe this is a key feature to make a good data scientist standout.

More details can be found on this [blog](https://medium.com/p/6e8067227ceb/edit). 

Step 1: The original IP Insights tutorial from AWS. More detailed illustration can be found here. 

Step 2: Adding noise to data.

Step 3: Using an alternative approach.

Have Fun!
